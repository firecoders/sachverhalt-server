# sachverhalt-server

#### The server-side reference implementation of the sachverhalt protocol

**This project has been abandoned.** We don't have see any reason to write
another issue-management system, as there are plenty of good options already.

The server is written and configured in haskell, akin to
[xmonad][xmonad]

`sachverhalt` is a JSON based issue-management protocol that aims to be simple
and extendable.

At the moment, there is no `sachverhalt` spec yet, but there are a few
[examples][examples]
JSON-objects to look at.

There is a
[standard client-side implementation][client-side]
to go along with this.
